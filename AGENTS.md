# Agent Guidance

- Work in small, reviewable commits.
- Do not add any application framework yet.
- Do not add any database schema yet.
- Never commit secrets (no .env, no credentials, no private keys).
- Assume production DB will be MySQL on Bluehost (managed via phpMyAdmin), but development may use SQLite later if needed.
- Prefer plain, readable code and minimal dependencies suitable for shared hosting.
